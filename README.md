TECHNICAL FEASIBILTY 

It centers on the existing computer system and to what extent it can support the proposed system. The system is technically feasible as existing system (hardware and software) etc is Sufficient for the proposed system. There will be no overburden of the system.
Example, if the current computer is operating at 0 percent capacity- an arbitrary ceiling- then running another application could overload the system or require addition hardware. This involves financial consideration to accommodate technical enhancements; if the budget is the serious constraint then the project is judged not feasible, a study of functions, performance and constraints.

This is concerned with specifying equipment and software that will successfully satisfy the user requirement. The technical needs of the system may vary considerably, but might include:
•	The facility to produce outputs in a given time.
•	Response time under certain conditions.
•	Ability to process a certain volume of transaction at a particular speed.

 REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

Considering the great impact of System Analysis on the overall project development a systematic and detailed analysis was conducted for the development of Production Management and Analysis System. Study was conducted to determine the initial scope of the system. Preliminary investigation comprising of request clarification, feasibility study etc. were carried out.

The current Search Method is manual and it was a failure, as it could not meet the entire requirement of the prospect clients. During analysis we studied manual system to find out their functionalities and deficiencies.

The fact-finding activities on a system study produces detail that describes current operation and point to areas where improvement is needed or possible. To evaluate the existing system analyst consider the current system capacity including the people, equipment, storage space, time and procedures involved

Purpose: 

Online Repairing Availability  manages customer as well as allow them to get the purchase online Items. Hence this project offers an effective solution  where user can view various Items available and select the brand and product.
